## Hosting

Lava runs on [Heroku](https://heroku.com) on a **free** plan. We are only granted **free 450 dyno hours (22 days)** to operate on their platform 24/7 since our team does not have any budget to operate the bot continuously. But starting November 1, 2022, the platform stated they will **no longer offer free tiers** since they found "abuse of their service" which we are confidently a part of. As a result, we had decided to remove the ability to host this on the aforementioned platform. Moreover, we had found an immediate solution so we are now **actively** finding another hosting service to resume Lava's operation.

## Requirements
Hosting your own instance is an easy task but we are not offering you support for it. But to just start off really *basic* you must have the following:

-   **Discord Bot Token** - This token allows you to connect to Discord.
-   **Node.JS 16.9+** - Node.JS provides you an environment to run server-side applications.
-   **MongoDB Database** - MongoDB is a document-based database to store data in JSON format.
-   **Code Editor** - To start development, install vscode, atom or any editors that support TypeScript.
-   **Yarn 3+** - Yarn is a node.js package manager, similar to NPM but this is faster and more secure.
-   **Knowledge** - A lot of fucking brain cells to read and write TypeScript code. 

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into your VPS or your local machine.
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Rename `.env-example` to `.env` and fill.
4. Build source code: `yarn run build`
5. Run to start: `yarn start`
