# Bot Rules
The developing team behind Lava wants to make sure everyone using the bot to have a safe and secure experience. Although Lava is designed to work on a larger audience, we want to make sure its servers and its users are following these initial sets of rules. Failure to comply with these will let us revoke your rights from Lava.

### For Servers
The following rules apply for Lava servers so if you own one and Lava is in one of it, regardless whether you use it or not, you must comply.
- [x] **User Population** - Your server must have at least **500+** people (excluding bot users) for the full economy experience. The server must also be competitive as a whole in order to be on "top" of the leaderboards.
- [x] **Bot Count** - In order for `/commands` to work properly, your server must have at most **50** bots. As of writing, Discord has yet to fix a weird bug where the server cannot use slash commands of bots added after the 50 mark.
- [x] **No ToS Violations** - We did not really wish tolerating an environment that has bad record with the mother app itself, Discord, which we describe as awful, disgusting, and embarrassing. We might not have the tools to indicate a ToS violation, but if we deem it as one, we will notify the owner of the server and take away its rights to use the Lava until the action performed regarding the violation is lifted.
- [x] **Cross-Bot Trading (CBT)** - Trading any currency from this bot to other bots and vice-versa is allowed to bots that allows CBT too. Certain bots like [Dank Memer](https://dankmemer.lol) does not allow such transactions to occur, and along with many other bots that do not support it similarly, is an exception.

### For Users
The following rules apply for Lava users. We might not see you violating one of these, it's a lot better to be honest as much as possible.
- [x] **Exploits** - Sharing or abusing of probably exploits that violates how the bot should work must not be tolerated.
- [x] **Botting** - Botting occurs when an automated script, machine or program is being used to perform actions for example, a certain game you are playing. But since Lava contains such games, you cannot use bots to automate commands. This also violates Discord's rule regarding self-bots.
- [x] **Discord ToS** - It's always the number one thing mentioned across discord servers. Please just stop fucking with Discord. It's for your own good.
